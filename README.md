# OMDb_API
ATG Movie Awards

Ji Hwan's project for creating movie DB web app using OBDb API `https://www.omdbapi.com/`

backend is for server and DB models

client is for the frontend using ReactJS, Redux. I'm using Material-UI for the UI components.

In this web app, you will be able to search movies with their title, and be able to save the movie to your list and delete them from your list.

Clicking on OMDb app title will redirect to main.
Clicking on list icon will redirect to mylist.
Clicking on User Avatar icon will redirect to login.

With user registration, user can create their account. And login with their created account.

I have learned and researched a lot for this project and it was genuinely fun and was great experience.

The technical requirements are completed, however for the extra requirements they are not yet completed
  User Login, User Registration is implemented, but the user interactions or loggedin state implementation are yet to be implemented
  User Logout is yet to be implemented
